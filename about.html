        <h1>Who is Cris Lawrence?</h1>
        <p class="abt">
            Kamusta! My name is Cris Lawrence Bautista Sidoro.<br>A student of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_University_(Philippines)">SLU Baguio</a>
            taking a course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.<br><br>
            Despite being born in Tarlac City, I was raised in San Mateo, Rizal,
            <br>where both of my parents work—my mother as a teacher and my father as an engineer.<br><br>
            When I was little, I developed an interest for both technology and art.<br>
            I used to draw cartoons and spend hours tinkering with wires in my father's toolbox.<br>
            As the years went by, I refined these abilities and had the opportunity to use them<br>
            to earn a living. Additionally, because I'm an artist, I also fell in love with music,<br>
            especially singing and playing the guitar. Finally, I also engage in photography and filmmaking.<br>
            Besides from arts, I’m also playing basketball and badminton.<br><br>
            Why did I choose this path? I actually didn't want to take this course because I was more<br>
            interested in filmmaking or architecture. My first experience with front-end development was<br>
            in the eleventh grade, when we were given the assignment to create a
            <a href="https://orodis.wordpress.com/">website</a> using WordPress.<br>
            Four years later, when I started my third year and focused on software engineering, everything changed.<br>
            Who would have guessed that you could create art with code.<br><br>
            I'm currently in my final year of college and serving as president of the<br>
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/samcischorale">SAMCIS Chorale</a>, the campus choir. As of now I am a Frontend Developer Intern at<br>
            <a href="https://www.codeandtheory.com/location/manila">CODE AND THEORY MANILA</a>.<br><br>
